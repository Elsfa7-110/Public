<p>Damn Vulnerable Web Services is a vulnerable web application with multiple backend web services which can be used for learning about Web Service Security. The application contains a number of vulnerabilities including SQL Injection and Server Side Request Forgery.</p>

<p>I wrote this application a while back to practice my PHP Development skills. Since releasing the application, I did get a number of requests for a walkthrough guide. I finally got permission from my university to release the paper I wrote while designing the application. </p>
