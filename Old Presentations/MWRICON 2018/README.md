#### Attacking AngularJS Applications

The modern web application development ecosystem has changed significantly over the last few years with the emergence of front-end frameworks. Moreover, front-end JavaScript frameworks such as AngularJS brings new functionality and features to a web application. However, AngularJS can often bring additional attack surface to an already secure application. This workshop will look at the security aspects of AngularJS applications and give the attendee a thorough introduction to finding and exploiting Angular specific vulnerabilities. This workshop consists of the following topics:

* Introduction to AngularJS
* Cross Site-Scripting and AngularJS
* Template Injection
* Sandbox Bypasses
* Local Storage
* Cross-Site Request Forgery and JSON Hijacking
* Client Side routing and Authorisation Issues

Attendees are welcome to participate through the workshop by having access to a vulnerable application. Access to all tools and examples demonstrated on the day will be provided. The duration of the workshop will be 1 hour 45 minutes. Attendees wishing to participate are required to bring the following:
*	Laptop with 32/64-bit operating system with at least 4 GB RAM, 15 GB free hard drive space, USB port (2.0 or 3.0), and administrative access
